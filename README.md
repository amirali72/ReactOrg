# React Internship Assignment

This repository contains a React application developed for an internship assignment. The application is built using Vite and TypeScript, and it incorporates various functionalities as outlined in the assignment requirements.

## Project Overview

### Task 1: Application Configuration

- Created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), a fast web development build tool.
- TypeScript is used for static typing.
- Configured with [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) for a consistent and responsive UI.

### Task 2: First Page of the Application

- Implemented a user data form to collect information such as Name, Phone number, and Email.
- Stored user details in local storage upon completion.
- Implemented route navigation to redirect users to the second page.
- Redirects users back to the first page with a message if accessing the second page without providing necessary details.

### Task 3: Second Page of the Application [Component 1]

- Fetches JSON data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).
- Converts the retrieved JSON data into TypeScript models/interfaces.
- Displays the data in a table using the [React Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) component.

### Task 4: Second Page of the Application [Component 2]

- Creates a hierarchical department structure using hardcoded JSON data.
- Allows users to expand or collapse sub-departments.
